A WIP, In-Raid Traders mod for Single Player Tarkov

---
    
## Installation
    
You will need **SPT version 3.11.x** installed. Unzip and drag the mod into the root of your SPT install, where the EXE is located.
The mod should be under the path *SPTLocation/BepInEx/plugins/In-RaidTraders.dll*.

### Trader Locations
- â€‹**Prapor**: Woods new area, accessible by BTR driver.
- **Jaeger**: 3 locations around woods, 33% chance between the three, find him!
- **Therapist**: Streets, in between sewer river and factory marked room, past the fence gate you need to breach.
- **Ragman**: Interchange, on the main road in a inflatable tent.
- **Mechanic**: Factory, Camera Bunker Door.
- **Skier**: Shoreline, Watchtower near the minefields in the southeast wall.
- **Peacekeeper**: Shoreline, UN bunker near Climber's Trail.
- **Ref**: No location currently, will be adding ASAP.
- **Fence**: Scattered across all maps but Customs, Labs, Lighthouse, and Ground Zero, will be added to the rest ASAP. Typically under arches and in dark places.

### Building with Rider

In-RaidTraders uses a typical C# project structure and can be built by simply running the default `Debug` or `Release` task. 
After Rider finishes building the project, you can find the built mod in `bin/Debug` or `bin/Release`. Feel free to open a pull request!

### Adding your trader as an In-Raid Trader:

To add your trader to IRT as a custom trader in game currently is simple. 
- Add a localization JSON to the `InRaidTraders-Server/data/Locales/en/`, an example exists under `en` that shows where to place your JSON and how to format it.
- Add a Config JSON to the `InRaidTraders-Core/Configs/`, It contains options for the trader mongo ID, name which is used in localization, whether you can access them anywhere using a `UnityEngine.KeyCode` integer keybind, the location of the interactable cube in the world, rotation, and scale, and the map. Included is a debug option that renders the cube, reccommended to see for average user. 
Currently only 1 map is supported, next update should fix this.

### Development

If you are going to help develop the mod (which I highly recommend!) I only ask that you pull request your feature!
